Sharepoint portal has been very helpful in maintaining a secured site for uploading important documents regarding Mock, NGO and other projects. The attendance and leaves generated by YODAs were efficiently tracked by the respective squad leaders. The scoreboards of YODAs and Squads are updated daily, maintaining a competitive environment around the office. The YODAS can refer course materials distributed in a month-wise format. Overall, the sharepoint portal is beneficial for both YODAS and the Squad Leaders.
