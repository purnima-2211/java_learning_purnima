Design a Queue class such that it satisfies following conditions:

1. Constructor with no arguments and with one argument, size of the queue

2. Enqueue operation which takes one input item and adds it to the queue and returns true if operation is successful

3. Dequeue operation which removes the item from the queue and returns that item

4. Print operation which prints the whole queue

5. Clear operation which clears all contents of the queue

6. Size operation which returns the number of items present in the queue at any point of time

7. IsPresent operation which takes input item to be found, it should return true/false

Please handle corner cases such as overflow and underflow of queue.

With default constructor take 10 as the default size of queue
